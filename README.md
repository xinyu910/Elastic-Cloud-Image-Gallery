# Elastic Cloud Image Gallery
Add autoscaler functionality based on https://github.com/xinyu910/Cloud-Image-Gallery

The project consists of 4 flask instances deployed in one EC2 instance: Frontend, ManagerAPP, AutoScaler and Memcache. Users can manually or automatically by setting some parameters to scale the memcache, such that there can be at most 7 additional memcache instances, each is hosted in a separate EC2 instance. The Frontend component allows users to upload and retrieve images from either RDS + R3 or memcache. Users can also use the UI of the Manager APP component to config memcache parameters and resize memcache pool. Manager App uses RDS to communicate with all Memcache pools for the configurations. Memcache components store images for future faster retrieval, and is responsible for publishing cloudwatch statistics metrics. Autoscaler component is responsible for the shrinking and expanding of the EC2 instances (memcache pool) after Manager APPâ€™s resize parameters are given.
